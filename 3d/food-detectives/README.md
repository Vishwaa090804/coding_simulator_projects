### Learning Modes Explained
You can now switch between two distinct ways to explore the food lab. Here’s how each mode works:

**📘 Learn Mode (Free Exploration)**
- **Use the Test Kit**: Click the **Starch, Protein, or Fat** buttons at the bottom, then click any food.
- **See Instant Results**: The right panel logs each result with color-coded entries (blue-black for starch, violet for protein, orange for fat).
- **Build Intuition**: Freely experiment to see which foods react to each test, just like in a real lab.

**❓ Quiz Mode (Guided Challenges)**
- **Answer the Question**: A random question asks you to find a food containing a specific nutrient (or none).
- **Click to Check**: Click on a food to see a detailed, playful explanation. It tells you if you're correct, shows the food's nutrient profile, and includes a fun fact, rhyme, and real-world connection.
- **Get Hints**: Use the hint button if you're stuck. A new question can be generated anytime.
